## MyScaleDB

**MyScale** is a open-source cloud-native SQL vector database optimized for AI applications and solutions, built on the open-source **ClickHouse** database, allowing us to effectively manage massive volumes of data for the development of robust and scalable AI applications. Some of the most significant benefits of using MyScale include:

* **Built for AI applications:** Manages and supports the analytical processing of structured and vectorized data on a single platform.
* **Built for performance and scalability:** Cutting-edge OLAP database architecture to perform operations on vectorized data at incredible speeds and scalability.
* **Built for universal accessibility**: SQL is the only programming language needed to interact with MyScale.

Compared with other products/platforms' customized APIs, MyScale is more powerful yet simpler to use; thus, suitable for a large community of programmers.

MyScale is a cost-effective, highly scalable data management solution that simplifies the handling of complex AI demands, eliminating the need for multiple, costly specialized data systems. With its standard SQL support, you can seamlessly query multiple data modalities through a single interface, allowing you to leverage structured, vector, text, time-series and more data types simultaneously with a single SQL query. This streamlined approach ensures rapid and efficient processing, saving time and reducing complexity, empowering you to tackle AI and big data tasks with ease.

## Why MyScaleDB

* Unified unstructured data and structured data management
* SQL vector database
* Millisecond search on billion vectors
* Highly reliable & linearly scalable
* Hybrid search & complex SQL vector queries
* Support disk-based vector index for high data density*

## Creating a MyScaleDB Instance

### MyScaleDB Cloud

The simplest way to use MyScaleDB is to start an instance on MyScale Cloud service. We offer a free pod supporting 5M 768D vectors. Sign up [here](https://myscale.com/) and checkout [MyScale QuickStart](https://myscale.com/docs/en/quickstart/) for more instructions.

### Self-Hosted

#### MyScaleDB Docker Image

*Recommended way, write more here, see: https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb?tab=readme-ov-file#paradedb-docker-image*

#### Build from source

*Just a short and concise description would work here*
