## What is MyScaleDB?

MyScaleDB is an open-source cloud-native SQL vector database optimized for AI applications and solutions, built on the open-source **ClickHouse** database, allowing us to effectively manage massive volumes of data for the development of robust and scalable AI applications. Some of the most significant benefits of using MyScaleDB include:

* **Fully SQL-Compatible**
  * Fast, powerful, and efficient vector search, filtered search, and SQL-vector join queries.
  * Use SQL with vector-related functions to interact with MyScaleDB. No need to learn complex new tools or frameworks – stick with what you know and love.
* **Production-Ready for AI applications**
  * A unified and time-tested platform to manage and process structured data, text, vector, JSON, geospatial, time-series data, and more.
  * Improved RAG accuracy by combining vectors with rich metadata and performing high-precision, high-efficiency filtered search at any ratio[^1].
* **Unmatched performance and scalability**
  * MyScaleDB leverages cutting-edge OLAP database architecture and advanced vector algorithms for lightning-fast vector operations.
  * Scale your applications effortlessly and cost-effectively as your data grows.

[^1]: See why metadata filtering is crucial for imporoving RAG accuracy [here](https://myscale.com/blog/filtered-vector-search-in-myscale/#filtered-vector-search-is-essential-for-improving-the-accuracy-of-rag-systems).

[MyScale Cloud](myscale.com) provides fully-managed MyScaleDB with premium features on billion-scale data[^2]. Compared with specialized vector databases that use custom APIs, MyScale is [more powerful, performant, and cost-effective](https://myscale.com/blog/myscale-outperform-specialized-vectordb) while remaining simpler to use. This makes it suitable for a large community of programmers. Additionally, when compared to integrated vector databases like PostgreSQL with pgvector or ElasticSearch with vector extensions, MyScale consumes fewer resources and [achieves better accuracy and speed for structured and vector joint queries](https://myscale.com/blog/myscale-vs-postgres-opensearch), such as filtered searches.

[^2]: The MSTG (Multi-scale Tree Graph) algorithm is provided through [MyScale Cloud](https://myscale.com), achieving high data density with disk-based storage and better indexing & search performance on billion-scale vector data.

Moreover, with MyScaleDB's SQL support and [rich data types and functions](https://myscale.com/docs/en/functions/), you can seamlessly manage and query multiple data modalities in a unified system. This allows you to leverage structured, vector, text, time-series, and other data types simultaneously with a single query. The SQL data model supports flexible and sophisticated data modeling, which has been battle-tested for [over half a century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#History). MyScaleDB's streamlined SQL vector approach ensures rapid and efficient processing, saving time and reducing complexity, empowering you to tackle AI/LLM and big data tasks with ease.

## Why MyScaleDB

* Unified structured and vectorized data management
* SQL vector database
* Millisecond search on billion vectors
* Highly reliable & linearly scalable
* Hybrid search & complex SQL vector queries

See our [documentation](https://myscale.com/docs/en/) and [blogs](https://myscale.com/blog/) for more about MyScale’s unique features and advantages. Our [open-source benchmark](https://myscale.github.io/benchmark/) provides detailed comparison with other vector database products.

## Why build MyScaleDB on top of ClickHouse?

[ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) is a popular open-source analytical database that excels at big data processing and analytics due to its columnar storage with advanced compression, skip indexing, and SIMD processing. Unlike transactional databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, which use row storage and main optimzies for transactional processing, ClickHouse has significantly faster analytical and data scanning speeds.

One of the key operations in combining structured and vector search is filtered search, which involves filtering by other attributes first and then performing vector search on the remaining data. [Columnar storage and pre-filtering are crucial](https://myscale.com/blog/filtered-vector-search-in-myscale/#behind-the-scene) for ensuring high accuracy and high performance in filtered search, which is why we chose to build MyScaleDB on top of ClickHouse.

While we have modified ClickHouse's execution and storage engine in many ways to ensure fast and cost-effective SQL vector queries, many of the features ([#37893](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37893), [#38048](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38048), [#37859](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37859), [#56728](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/56728), [#58223](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58223)) related to general SQL processing have been contributed back to the ClickHouse open source community.

## Creating a MyScaleDB Instance

### MyScale Cloud

The simplest way to use MyScaleDB is to start an instance on MyScale Cloud service. We offer a free pod supporting 5M 768D vectors. Sign up [here](https://myscale.com/) and checkout [MyScaleDB QuickStart](https://myscale.com/docs/en/quickstart/) for more instructions.

### Self-Hosted

#### MyScaleDB Docker Image

To quickly get a MyScaleDB instance up and running, simply pull and run the latest Docker image:

```bash
docker run --name myscaledb myscale/myscaledb:1.4
```

This will start a MyScaleDB instance with default user `default` and no password. You can then connect to the database using `clickhouse-client`:

```bash
docker exec -it myscaledb clickhouse-client
```

To install MyScaleDB locally or on-premise, we recommend using Docker Compose to deploy MyScaleDB. Below is the recommended directory structure and the location of the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

```bash
❯ tree myscaledb
myscaledb
├── docker-compose.yaml
└── volumes

1 directory, 1 file
```

After familiarizing yourself with the directory structure and the location of the `docker-compose.yaml` file, the next step is to define the configuration for your deployment. We recommend starting with the following configuration in your `docker-compose.yaml` file, which you can adjust based on your specific requirements:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  myscaledb:
    image: myscale/myscaledb:1.4
    tty: true
    ports:
      - '8123:8123'
      - '9000:9000'
      - '8998:8998'
      - '9363:9363'
      - '9116:9116'
    volumes:
      - ${DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY:-.}/volumes/data:/var/lib/clickhouse
      - ${DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY:-.}/volumes/log:/var/log/clickhouse-server
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "16.00"
          memory: 32Gb
```

Use the following command to get it running:

```bash
cd myscaledb
docker compose up -d
```

You can access the myscaledb command line interface using the following command. From now on, you are free to execute SQL statements.

```bash
docker exec -it myscaledb-myscaledb-1 clickhouse-client
```

If you want to customize the configuration file of MyScaleDB, please first copy the `/etc/clickhouse-server` directory from your `myscaledb` container to a directory on your local physical machine. Assuming you have copied it to the `volumes/config` directory, you can freely modify the configuration within the `volumes/config` directory. Then, you just need to add a directory mapping in the above-mentioned `docker-compose.yaml` file to make the configuration take effect.
Here is the mapping of this configuration file:

```yaml
- ${DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY:-.}/volumes/config:/etc/clickhouse-server
```

## Tutorial

Please refer to our [guide](https://myscale.com/docs/en/vector-search/) for how to create a SQL table with vector index and perform vector search. It's recommended to specify `TYPE SCANN` when creating a vector index in open source MyScaleDB.

### Create a Table with Vector Column

```sql
-- Create a table with body_vector of length 384
CREATE TABLE default.wiki_abstract
(
    `id` UInt64,
    `body` String,
    `title` String,
    `url` String,
    `body_vector` Array(Float32),
    CONSTRAINT check_length CHECK length(body_vector) = 384
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY id;
```

### Insert Data to Your Table

```sql
-- Insert data from parquet files on S3
INSERT INTO default.wiki_abstract SELECT * FROM s3('https://myscale-datasets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wiki_abstract_with_vector.parquet','Parquet');
```

### Create the Vector Index

```sql
-- Build a SCANN vector index with Cosine metric on the body_vector
ALTER TABLE default.wiki_abstract ADD VECTOR INDEX vec_idx body_vector TYPE SCANN('metric_type=Cosine');

-- Query the index build progress from the `vector_indices` table
-- Wait until the index progress becomes `Built`
SELECT * FROM system.vector_indices;
```

### Execute Vector Search

```sql
-- Perform vector search return the top-5 results
SELECT
  id,
  title,
  distance(body_vector, [-0.052, -0.0146, -0.0677, -0.0256, -0.0395, -0.0381, -0.025, 0.0911, -0.0429, -0.0592, 0.0017, -0.0358, -0.0464, -0.0189, -0.0192, 0.0544, -0.0022, -0.0292, -0.0474, -0.0286, 0.0746, -0.013, -0.0217, -0.0246, -0.0169, 0.0495, -0.0947, 0.0139, 0.0445, -0.0262, -0.0049, 0.0506, 0.004, 0.0276, 0.0063, -0.0643, 0.0059, -0.0229, -0.0315, 0.0549, 0.1427, 0.0079, 0.011, -0.0036, -0.0617, 0.0155, -0.0607, 0.0258, -0.0205, 0.0008, -0.0547, 0.0329, -0.0522, -0.0347, 0.0921, 0.0139, -0.013, 0.0716, -0.0165, 0.0257, -0.0071, 0.0084, -0.0653, 0.0091, 0.0544, -0.0192, -0.0169, -0.0017, -0.0304, 0.0427, -0.0389, 0.0921, -0.0622, -0.0196, 0.0025, 0.0214, 0.0259, -0.0493, -0.0211, -0.119, -0.0736, -0.1545, -0.0578, -0.0145, 0.0138, 0.0478, -0.0451, -0.0332, 0.0799, 0.0001, -0.0737, 0.0427, 0.0517, 0.0102, 0.0386, 0.0233, 0.0425, -0.0279, -0.0529, 0.0744, -0.0305, -0.026, 0.1229, -0.002, 0.0038, -0.0491, 0.0352, 0.0027, -0.056, -0.1044, 0.123, -0.0184, 0.1148, -0.0189, 0.0412, -0.0347, -0.0569, -0.0119, 0.0098, -0.0016, 0.0451, 0.0273, 0.0436, 0.0082, 0.0166, -0.0989, 0.0747, -0.0, 0.0306, -0.0717, -0.007, 0.0665, 0.0452, 0.0123, -0.0238, 0.0512, -0.0116, 0.0517, 0.0288, -0.0013, 0.0176, 0.0762, 0.1284, -0.031, 0.0891, -0.0286, 0.0132, 0.003, 0.0433, 0.0102, -0.0209, -0.0459, -0.0312, -0.0387, 0.0201, -0.027, 0.0243, 0.0713, 0.0359, -0.0674, -0.0747, -0.0147, 0.0489, -0.0092, -0.018, 0.0236, 0.0372, -0.0071, -0.0513, -0.0396, -0.0316, -0.0297, -0.0385, -0.062, 0.0465, 0.0539, -0.033, 0.0643, 0.061, 0.0062, 0.0245, 0.0868, 0.0523, -0.0253, 0.0157, 0.0266, 0.0124, 0.1382, -0.0107, 0.0835, -0.1057, -0.0188, -0.0786, 0.057, 0.0707, -0.0185, 0.0708, 0.0189, -0.0374, -0.0484, 0.0089, 0.0247, 0.0255, -0.0118, 0.0739, 0.0114, -0.0448, -0.016, -0.0836, 0.0107, 0.0067, -0.0535, -0.0186, -0.0042, 0.0582, -0.0731, -0.0593, 0.0299, 0.0004, -0.0299, 0.0128, -0.0549, 0.0493, 0.0, -0.0419, 0.0549, -0.0315, 0.1012, 0.0459, -0.0628, 0.0417, -0.0153, 0.0471, -0.0301, -0.0615, 0.0137, -0.0219, 0.0735, 0.083, 0.0114, -0.0326, -0.0272, 0.0642, -0.0203, 0.0557, -0.0579, 0.0883, 0.0719, 0.0007, 0.0598, -0.0431, -0.0189, -0.0593, -0.0334, 0.02, -0.0371, -0.0441, 0.0407, -0.0805, 0.0058, 0.1039, 0.0534, 0.0495, -0.0325, 0.0782, -0.0403, 0.0108, -0.0068, -0.0525, 0.0801, 0.0256, -0.0183, -0.0619, -0.0063, -0.0605, 0.0377, -0.0281, -0.0097, -0.0029, -0.106, 0.0465, -0.0033, -0.0308, 0.0357, 0.0156, -0.0406, -0.0308, 0.0013, 0.0458, 0.0231, 0.0207, -0.0828, -0.0573, 0.0298, -0.0381, 0.0935, -0.0498, -0.0979, -0.1452, 0.0835, -0.0973, -0.0172, 0.0003, 0.09, -0.0931, -0.0252, 0.008, -0.0441, -0.0938, -0.0021, 0.0885, 0.0088, 0.0034, -0.0049, 0.0217, 0.0584, -0.012, 0.059, 0.0146, -0.0, -0.0045, 0.0663, 0.0017, 0.0015, 0.0569, -0.0089, -0.0232, 0.0065, 0.0204, -0.0253, 0.1119, -0.036, 0.0125, 0.0531, 0.0584, -0.0101, -0.0593, -0.0577, -0.0656, -0.0396, 0.0525, -0.006, -0.0149, 0.003, -0.1009, -0.0281, 0.0311, -0.0088, 0.0441, -0.0056, 0.0715, 0.051, 0.0219, -0.0028, 0.0294, -0.0969, -0.0852, 0.0304, 0.0374, 0.1078, -0.0559, 0.0805, -0.0464, 0.0369, 0.0874, -0.0251, 0.0075, -0.0502, -0.0181, -0.1059, 0.0111, 0.0894, 0.0021, 0.0838, 0.0497, -0.0183, 0.0246, -0.004, -0.0828, 0.06, -0.1161, -0.0367, 0.0475, 0.0317]) AS distance
